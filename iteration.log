1.  went with simple numbers,
    movement too easy, game over before you know it, very fast - which is not entirely bad,
    but there was almost no fighting at all.
    Shields at 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7
    3 victory points but kept playing to lengthen game
    Hand size 4
    Played opposite locations.

2.  made movement more expensive,
    added 'big sword',
    removed cleanse in favour of trash every turn
    added chocolate cake required to be played for victory points
    5 victory points total
    Added impassable swamps to map to slow movement
    Hand size 5?
    Played opposite locations.

3.  Made cake more (too?) expensive
    Swapped simple move/attacks for 'characters' with generated price/colour/descriptions
    Only one character per minion per turn.
    Hand size 5
    Game much longer (cake too expensive) - abandoned at 1 vp.!
    Good use of weapons and shields throughout (up to 9 shields purchased)
    Ranged weapons un-purchased
    High value money not dense enough
    Player 2 never afforded cake!
    Maybe knight too damaging?
    Cleanse rarely used
    Played opposite locations.

4.  Raised money values.
    Made Cleanse cheaper (3 -> 1) Used on 4 tokens in whole game.
    No cost penalty for range.
    Increased movement for ranged characters.
    Reduced Knight damage. (5 -> 4)
    Game was close - tendency to stay home and build money before moving anywhere.
    Played opposite locations.

5.  Made money more expensive but worth less.
    Added spaces that earn +3 Spend, +1 Token and G.C.
    Removed G.C. as a token.
    Game was long, a bit drawn out at the end.
    Played adjacent locations.
    Bonus spaces consumed a lot of time, much fighting over them, one player dominated by controlling them.
    Knave, Scout, Axeman, Longbowman never bought
    Suggestions:
        Bonus spaces less valuable?
        2x +2 Spend
        1x G.C.
        Make +1 Token a playable token. (cost: ?) And it would need some other benefit or it has no purpose!
        Move straight ahead bonus space back one.

6.  Chocolate cake cheaper (12 -> 10)
    Added blacksmith (no-one bought one)
    Re-worked auto-pricing. No-one bought Axeman.
    Removed Knave, Pikeman and Longbowman
    Moved +1 token space to straight ahead (Swapped for spend bonus), pushed it back one
    Reduced spend bonus space (+3 -> +2)
    G.C. space grants +1 token if used.
    Game still long, most time spent fighting, rather than winning.
    Shields go back and forth a lot without much sense of progress.
        (boring war of attrition with lots of petty mental arithmetic?)
    Played adjacent locations.

7.  Blacksmith cheaper (8 -> 6)
    +1 token for Farmer (nee 'Peasant') and Axeman
    +2 coin for Scout and Swordsman
    Moved G.C. to center bonus space, removed other bonus spaces
    Played non-adjacent locations.
    Game boring at first
        - first three hands required ZERO interesting decisions for either player!
    Game faster moving to conclusion ~30 mins. vs. ~60 mins.
    No one bought Axeman Swordsman or Knight (all characters costing more than 7)
        - and archer was only just bought by the end
        i.e. for most of the game neither player could damage the other!

    suggestions:
        somehow make people buy higher value characters?
            make them cheaper?, more (some) damage for cheaper characters?
        Blacksmith should be a character

Hypothesis - adjacent play = battle, non-adjacent play = race to castle

Suggestions:
    play a game with no bonus spaces to attack/defend, but adjacent players.
