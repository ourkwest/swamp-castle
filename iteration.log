1.  went with simple numbers,
    movement too easy, game over before you know it, very fast - which is not entirely bad,
    but there was almost no fighting at all.
    Shields at 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7
    3 victory points but kept playing to lengthen game
    Hand size 4

2.  made movement more expensive,
    added 'big sword',
    removed cleanse in favour of trash every turn
    added chocolate cake required to be played for victory points
    5 victory points total
    Added impassable swamps to map to slow movement
    Hand size 5?

3.  Made cake more (too?) expensive
    Swapped simple move/attacks for 'characters' with generated price/colour/descriptions
    Only one character per minion per turn.
    Hand size 5
    Game much longer (cake too expensive) - abandoned at 1 vp.!
    Good use of weapons and shields throughout (up to 9 shields purchased)
    Ranged weapons un-purchased
    High value money not dense enough
    Player 2 never afforded cake!
    Maybe knight too damaging?
    Cleanse rarely used

4.  Raised money values.
    Made Cleanse cheaper (3 -> 1) Used on 4 tokens in whole game.
    No cost penalty for range.
    Increased movement for ranged characters.
    Reduced Knight damage. (5 -> 4)
    Game was close - tendency to stay home and build money before moving anywhere.

5.  Made money more expensive but worth less.
    Added spaces that earn +3 Spend, +1 Token and G.C.
    Removed G.C. as a token.
    Game was long, a bit drawn out at the end.
    Bonus spaces consumed a lot of time, much fighting over them, one player dominated by controlling them.
    Knave, Scout, Axeman, Longbowman never bought
    Suggestions:
        Bonus spaces less valuable?
        2x +2 Spend
        1x G.C.
        Make +1 Token a playable token. (cost: ?)
