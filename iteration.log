1.  went with simple numbers,
    movement too easy, game over before you know it, very fast - which is not entirely bad,
    but there was almost no fighting at all.
    Shields at 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7
    3 victory points but kept playing to lengthen game
    Hand size 4

2.  made movement more expensive,
    added 'big sword',
    removed cleanse in favour of trash every turn
    added chocolate cake required to be played for victory points
    5 victory points total
    Added impassable swamps to map to slow movement
    Hand size 5?

3.  Made cake more (too?) expensive
    Swapped simple move/attacks for 'characters' with generated price/colour/descriptions
    Hand size 5
    Game much longer (cake too expensive) - abandoned at 1 vp.!
    Good use of weapons and shields throughout (up to 9 shields purchased)
    Ranged weapons un-purchased
    High value money not dense enough
    Player 2 never afforded cake!
    Maybe knight too damaging?
    Cleanse rarely used
