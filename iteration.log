1.  went with simple numbers,
    movement too easy, game over before you know it, very fast - which is not entirely bad,
    but there was almost no fighting at all.
    Shields at 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7
    3 victory points but kept playing to lengthen game
    Hand size 4
    Played opposite locations.

2.  made movement more expensive,
    added 'big sword',
    removed cleanse in favour of trash every turn
    added chocolate cake required to be played for victory points
    5 victory points total
    Added impassable swamps to map to slow movement
    Hand size 5?
    Played opposite locations.

3.  Made cake more (too?) expensive
    Swapped simple move/attacks for 'characters' with generated price/colour/descriptions
    Only one character per minion per turn.
    Hand size 5
    Game much longer (cake too expensive) - abandoned at 1 vp.!
    Good use of weapons and shields throughout (up to 9 shields purchased)
    Ranged weapons un-purchased
    High value money not dense enough
    Player 2 never afforded cake!
    Maybe knight too damaging?
    Cleanse rarely used
    Played opposite locations.

4.  Raised money values.
    Made Cleanse cheaper (3 -> 1) Used on 4 tokens in whole game.
    No cost penalty for range.
    Increased movement for ranged characters.
    Reduced Knight damage. (5 -> 4)
    Game was close - tendency to stay home and build money before moving anywhere.
    Played opposite locations.

5.  Made money more expensive but worth less.
    Added spaces that earn +3 Spend, +1 Token and G.C.
    Removed G.C. as a token.
    Game was long, a bit drawn out at the end.
    Played adjacent locations.
    Bonus spaces consumed a lot of time, much fighting over them, one player dominated by controlling them.
    Knave, Scout, Axeman, Longbowman never bought
    Suggestions:
        Bonus spaces less valuable?
        2x +2 Spend
        1x G.C.
        Make +1 Token a playable token. (cost: ?) And it would need some other benefit or it has no purpose!
        Move straight ahead bonus space back one.

6.  Chocolate cake cheaper (12 -> 10)
    Added blacksmith (no-one bought one)
    Re-worked auto-pricing. No-one bought Axeman.
    Removed Knave, Pikeman and Longbowman
    Moved +1 token space to straight ahead (Swapped for spend bonus), pushed it back one
    Reduced spend bonus space (+3 -> +2)
    G.C. space grants +1 token if used.
    Game still long, most time spent fighting, rather than winning.
    Shields go back and forth a lot without much sense of progress.
        (boring war of attrition with lots of petty mental arithmetic?)
    Played adjacent locations.

7.  Blacksmith cheaper (8 -> 6)
    +1 token for Farmer (nee 'Peasant') and Axeman
    +2 coin for Scout and Swordsman
    Moved G.C. to center bonus space, removed other bonus spaces
    Played non-adjacent locations.
    Game boring at first
        - first three hands required ZERO interesting decisions for either player!
    Game faster moving to conclusion ~30 mins. vs. ~60 mins.
    No one bought Axeman Swordsman or Knight (all characters costing more than 7)
        - and archer was only just bought by the end
        i.e. for most of the game neither player could damage the other!

    suggestions:
        somehow make people buy higher value characters?
            make them cheaper?, more (some) damage for cheaper characters?
        Blacksmith should be a character

Hypothesis - adjacent play = battle, non-adjacent play = race to castle

Suggestions:
    play a game with no bonus spaces to attack/defend, but adjacent players.

8.  Played with 4 players (only one of whom was me.)
    Increased cake price (10 -> 12)
    Made blacksmith a character (requires a minion to play - but people always seemed to have a spare one)
    Limited to 5 minions

    Length: ~45 minutes
    Players assumed they could train new minions on any starting spot throughout the game.
    'Train' tokens were bought and trashed.
        "why should I be able to buy more when one is almost always enough"
        perhaps train should be not a token, but you can pay x to do it on any turn?
        perhaps subsequent trainees cost more? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or even super-linear?
            if cost for more minions increased that might limit playable tokens
                and cause people to grow their economies,
                then be able to afford more expensive things? (sounds a bit tenuous)
    Makes sense to enforce GC at start of turn and spend at end of turn
    Suggested rename 'GC' -> 'Midden', 'Train' -> 'Slave Market'???
    Suggested losing the minion when you buy the victory point? (and possibly pay as well?)
    Starting condition is sub-optimal, with more than 1 hands worth of tokens the first hand would be random.
        plus more interesting options please!
    Again not much use of weapons, dispute many adjacent players
    Also, lots of congestion, especially in the middle
        the castle was nearly full for several rounds at the end
    Suggested 'Scout' only grant 1 extra coin
        many scouts were bought, they seemed to be a bargain
    0 knights, 1 axeman, 1 swordsman, 2 archers, 13 scouts, +2 farmers
    Blacksmiths bought and used.

9.  TODO: change log from diff
    two player game against a real person
    outcome:
        really good at first
        really slow in the middle
            took ages to afford '4 coins' (cost 8)
            many, many, many turns of having 7 to spend!!! (too many)
            during this lull, there were no interesting decisions to be made
        other person gave up before end (hand #38)
        one victory point bought
        other player thought archers should not be able to fire over walls
        no one bought 'Dagger' or 'Sword'
        it was suggested that every character token allow you to draw another token
            you are limited by minions anyway, so the 'runaway chaining turn' problem is limited.

10. TODO: change log from diff
    rewrote most character tokens
        All character tokens grant +1 token now
    completely redrew map
        linear race from start to finish
        large midden centre-start
            one player was able to mostly control the midden
        walls near end
        sporadic trees (+1 shield against every attack)
            possibly too powerful (makes minion immune from archers and brigands)
            or maybe that's good?

    two player game against a real person:
        gave up at first VP after half an hour on hand #21
        much more fun (commented on by other player)
        every token bought at least once
        money available per hand progressed more smoothly upwards
            no massive hump to overcome at 7 coins!
        suggestion:
            playing midden should prevent minion from doing something else
            character token that grants extra shields to a minion while others take their turns...?
                a bit complex

    four player game with real people: (and new map)
        used minion costs on token card (not in ui, which is different)
        played to completion after 2 hours in hand #19
        all 5 victory points acquired. Scores (VPs): 1, 1, 2, 1, Decks: 12, 12, 11, 14
        three players acquired 1 VP and then one player got 2 to end the game after building deck more aggressively early on.
        Berserker bought once, never used
        Archer lightly used
        Assassin heavily used (especially by winner)
        Winner bought: coins, brigands, assassins and 1 horse rider
        Shields got very expensive with 4 players up to about 11 in cost (made blacksmiths more desirable)
        comments:
            more fun than before, but still a little slow and repetitive, especially at the beginning
            2 hours is a bit long for a 'simple' game
            winning player was able to effectively max out his deck and then get VPs,
                had we attacked him on the midden earlier on we might have prevented him, so tactic may be preventable
                not ideal that he maxed out his deck though
                if game was faster, he would have had to compromise more (sooner) on deck building to dash for victory
            midden too powerful, smaller?, no redraw?, further from start?
            state that you can choose to withhold shields
            state when in turn you can G.C. and spend
            maybe you could buy your starting deck?
        Game could be faster by:
            making map shorter
            adding movement points to characters

        misc:
            stack the 1-value shields?
            character symbol on midden
            font size too small
            keyboard shortcuts
            add player name
            explanation for chocolate cake
            'shield' -> 'health potion' (moves from historical to magical)

11. played two player
    smaller board
    midden past river
    tweaked characters slightly
    graphical overhaul
    game
        under 1 hour
        reasonably fun
        one player didn't get enough money at the start and lost
        VPs: 3 vs 1 - game a bit one-sided
        bezerker hardly used (could have more movement
        early game all about getting more money
        mid game all about the midden
        end game about buying up shields
    feedback
        more shields
        more movement
        more attack
        more "stuff to do"

        maybe a super powerful character that is really expensive? (Knight for 16?)


12. played three player
        assassin underpowered/overpriced? relative to bezerker
            bezerker to only 4 movement?
        brigand too expensive
        knight may as well be 5m/5d at that price!
        1 money cost 1 money?
        quite long 1:30 hr
        write down rules!!!

13. played three player
        played to all 5 victory points - and then played a sixth one!!!
        game enjoyed, took about 2 hours
        no major criticisms
        Farmer unused
        Knight only bought right at the end of the game
        Farmer could give more money
        Knight could be cheaper
        Not sure anyone ever bought their penultimate minion, let alone their last minion.
        Suggested scale for minion prices: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
        Suggested Knight: 4 mv. 4 dmg. cost: 12
        Suggested Farmer: 1 mv. 2 coin. cost: as-is (1)
        Wondered about Big Money: 3 coin, costing 8?

    reports of a 5 player game
        never got any VPs
        played for a long time
        everyone too busy killing each other

    Wondered about scaling:
        make board wider with more players?
            current board felt about right for 3 players, but definitely got more crowded towards the end
            if minions get cheaper then
        different prices for shields with more players?
            should shields scale sideways with number of players?
            i.e. 1 player:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
                 2 players: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3
                 3 players: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2

                ???
            2: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
            3: 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7
            4: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5
            5: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4

    instructions include playing time (20-40 minutes per player?)

14. long game, just over 2 and a half hours, 4 players (about 40 minutes per player, 2 of whom were new, 2 were not)
    everyone happy to play to 5 victory points though
    not many assassins bought (1?)
    played with physical tokens and bags, which was broadly successful
    complaint (again) about shield purchasing being unfair
    nearly ran out of silver tokens (there were 8 per player available, about 7 per player got used)

    ideas:
        fewer characters, ranging up to a lower highest price
        smaller board? OR more movement points per character
        more cheaper shields?
        some expensive shields first, so there's less of a first mover advantage
        cake much cheaper, and more VPs available. (+ (* 2 (count players)) 1) ?

15. removed three characters, increased movement and damage overall for remaining characters
    Played two player game
        Much shorter! 40-ish minutes. VPs: 3 vs. 1
        Every character bought and used at least once
        Other player stated that they enjoyed it more.

    Would be good to play 4 player.
    Maybe the trees are not worth the complexity cost? Might be more useful with more players?


16. played without the bags! draw specific replacements to hand by choice
        2 player, 1hr, 3:2 VPs (first after 15 minutes)
        interesting, but less judgement of risk about when money and cake will be in your hand
        only one silver bought, money seemed quite powerful, archer seemed quite powerful, farmer seemed quite powerful
        suggestions:
            card in front of each player with
                5 minion slots (and costs to buy, can be used for playing tokens too)
                4 hand slots
            just one token in hand at a time? - I like this idea!!!
                draw pile felt like a hand as well, could this be simplified?
                    eg. "draw pile" renamed "hand", play one token at a time
            need to clarify
                midden usage? at end of turn? before or after buying? draw another token?
                if using cake removes a minion, can you buy it back immediately?

17. played with bags again after a long break.
        2 player, ~ 1.75 hours 3/5:1/5 VPs - other player stated that they enjoyed it a lot.
        Rules need clarifying.
        Farmer too powerful? Maybe move OR money - adds some more decision making. Rename "Pedant"?
        Keep roles between turns - pick them up at the start of the next turn? - probably not a great idea - it would be interesting, but it's too big a change
        Tie break on VPs -> Shields -> Minions -> Money -> Draw
        Rename game "Cakewalk" ++
        VP dis-benefit? You put them in your deck and they are dead weights -> empty plates!! (once cake is gone!) ++
        "Shields"? probably fine though
        Blacksmith underpowered? - maybe 2 shields - would make them more useful, might speed up game as fewer minions would die.
                    - maybe 2 shields OR 2 movement?
        Swap price of blacksmith with cake (there's no need for cake to be expensive gameplay-wise, other than story)
        Trees remain pointless - but like the idea that they add gameplay texture to the map.
