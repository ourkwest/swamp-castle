1.  went with simple numbers,
    movement too easy, game over before you know it, very fast - which is not entirely bad,
    but there was almost no fighting at all.
    Shields at 1 1 1 2 2 3 4 5 6 7
    3 victory points but kept playing to lengthen game

2.  made movement more expensive,
    added 'big sword',
    removed cleanse in favour of trash every turn
    added chocolate cake required to be played for victory points
    5 victory points total
    Added impassable swamps to map to slow movement
